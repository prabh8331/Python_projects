### Our Blackjack House Rules 

Goal of game is to add up cards to the largest number without going over 21. 
If cards add up to more than 21 it's called a bust and we loose 

If dealer pulls another card and his sum is less than 17 (<17) then they must take another card 

1. The deck is unlimited in size. 
2. There are no jokers. 
3. The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
4. The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
5. Use the following list as the deck of cards:
6. cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
7. The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
8. Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
9. The computer is the dealer.
