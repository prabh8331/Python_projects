### Hangman Game coding

<details>
    <summary>Game Rules:</summary>
    1. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter or number of the word. <br>
    2. Rules may permit or forbid proper nouns, such as names, places, brands, or slang. <br>
    3. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. <br>
    4. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player removes (or alternatively, adds) one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. <br>
    5. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.<br>
    6. The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. <br>
    7. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. <br>
    8. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. <br>
    9. On the other hand, if the guesser makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the other player to complete the diagram, the guesser loses. <br>
    10. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed<br>

[`First try on Hangman flow chart`](Flow_chart/Hangman_my_first_try.png) : Issue with this is I am trying to show how I will write a code, but in flow chart it is better to draw a logic, example is below:
